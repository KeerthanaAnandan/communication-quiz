            <h3>
              Growing up, I learned to be seen and not heard-much of the time.
              It was not until I was in my mid-teens, where I felt I was
              starting to be heard. However, hearing is really only one layer of
              the multi layered cake that is communication. This affected me in
              my marriage. I even gave myself the name of the shut down queen,
              and let me tell you-I had to work on myself. I did not know until
              grad school about the many forms of communication. All of the
              couples that come to me, struggle with this very component,
              because like above, it is many layers to communication. First,
              what type of communicator are you? You need to know where you in
              order to get to where you are going. So I created a brief quiz, to
              help you understand what type of communicator you are.
